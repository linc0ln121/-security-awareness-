### security awareness notes ###
 #Use two-factor authentication (2FA) on all GitHub and email accounts.

# Never click unknown links or approve suspicious OAuth app requests.

# Verify sender identity before sharing credentials or repository access.

# Store secrets securely in GitHub Secrets / vaults — not in code.

# Review audit logs and revoke unused tokens regularly.

# Enable branch protection and require verified commits.

# Apply rate-limits and firewalls to reduce DDoS impact.

# Monitor CI/CD pipelines for unusual workflow activity.

# Use CDNs and caching to absorb traffic spikes.

# Report phishing or abuse immediately to GitHub Support.
